# FSK
## Aim:
  To evaluate the performance and reliability of Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) modulation in digital communication systems under various noise conditions.
  
## Tools required:

  * Colab (for executing Python code)
  * Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib
    
## Program:
~~~
~~~

## Output Waveform:

## Results:
  * FSK effectively encoded digital data using different frequencies.
  * It showed strong resistance to noise and interference.
  * The method enhanced overall transmission reliability.
    
The experiment confirmed FSK as a robust choice for digital communication.
